if __name__ == '__main__':
    # if we type python app.py, __main__ is assigned to app.py
if we import another file, it will not run any class or function, but it
will run the statements, like print(), which is fine, but we don't want to
run app.run(port=5000, debug=True), which runs the Flask app which we runs from another file
